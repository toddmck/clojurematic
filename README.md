# clojurematic
Idiomatic clojure application creator

### Motivation
To make initial configuration and design of a clojure application simple and
intuitive for beginners. The idea is to take the basic data structure of an
application and generate datomic schema, data access code, rest api, routing,
and a generic javascript single-page app to do basic CRUD.
